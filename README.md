# Animated CSS3 Gallery

My first attempt to first edition of contest Mozilla DevDerby: June 2011 CSS3 Animations

Original description:
**Gallery with moving list of images and fading in zoomed photos**

The gallery is using CSS3 animations as well as JavaScript to actions directly connected with CSS like as computing current position of moving elements or managing classes. All animations are defined in CSS.
